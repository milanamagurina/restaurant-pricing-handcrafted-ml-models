This repository explores manual implementation of machine learning models for restaurant price prediction, focusing on classification, regression, and clustering. The project demonstrates how feature engineering impacts model complexity, performance, and generalization.

This project explores the development of **machine learning models** for predicting restaurant pricing, focusing on the impact of **feature complexity** on model performance and generalization.

## Approach

- **Manually implemented** models for **classification and regression**, building them from the ground up.
- Developed a **baseline model** using simple features, then progressively introduced **additional predictors** to enhance distinction and predictive power.
- Extended the models to **clustering**, grouping restaurants based on pricing and characteristics.
- Analyzed the trade-off between **model complexity and overfitting**, demonstrating how increasing feature space influences generalization.
- Evaluated performance using **various metrics**, ensuring a balance between accuracy and interpretability.
- Emphasized the **importance of high-quality data**, showcasing how preprocessing and feature selection impact reliability.

## Key Insights

This research highlights **manual ML model development**, demonstrating how strategic feature engineering can improve classification and clustering while maintaining generalizability.
